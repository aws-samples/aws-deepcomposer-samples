**Lab 2- Train a custom GAN model**

As part of this lab, you will learn to build a custom GAN architecture and train the model. Follow the steps below:

Navigate to Amazon SageMaker using the link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/dashboard

Click **Notebook instances** from the left navigation bar

Select **Create notebook instance**

![create-notebook](images/create_notebook.png)

Within the notebook instance creation form, select "c5.4xlarge" for **Notebook instance type**

![notebook-instance-settings](images/notebook_instance_settings.png)

Set the following for **Permissions and encryption**:
* IAM role: Use an existing role or create a new role
* Root access: Enable
* Encryption key: No Custom Encryption

Set the following for **Git repositories**:
* Repository: Clone a public Git repository to this notebook instance only
* Git repository URL: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepcomposer-samples

*You will likely be prompted to select kernel. Choose the drop down and select **conda_python3** as the kernel*

This notebook contains instructions and code to create a custom GAN model from scratch. Scroll through the notebook content.

![run-notebook](images/run-notebook.PNG)

To run the code cells, choose the code cell you want to run and click **Run**

![kernel-empty](images/kernel-empty.png)

If the kernel has an empty circle, it means it is free and ready to execute the code 

![kernel-busy](images/kernel-busy.png)

If the kernel has a filled circle, it means it is busy. Wait for it to become free before you execute the next line of code.

**Congratulations on building a custom GAN model from scratch!**
