    "This tutorial is a brief introduction to music generation using **Generative Adversarial Networks** (**GAN**s). \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to train a machine learning model using a dataset of Bach compositions so that the model learns to add accompaniments to a single track input melody. In other words, if the user provides a single piano track of a song such as \"twinkle twinkle little star\", the GAN model would add three other piano tracks to make the music sound more Bach-inspired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed algorithm consists of two competing networks: a generator and a critic (discriminator). A generator is a deep neural network that learns to create new synthetic data that resembles the distribution of the dataset on which it was trained. A critic is another deep neural network that is trained to differentiate between real and synthetic data. The generator and the critic are trained in alternating cycles such that the generator learns to produce more and more realistic data (Bach-like music in this use case) while the critic iteratively gets better at learning to differentiate real data (Bach music) from the synthetic ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "While GANs are a major breakthrough for generative modeling, plain GANs are also notoriously difficult to train. Some common problems encountered are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Oscillating loss:** The loss of the discriminator and generator can start to oscillate without exhibiting any long term stability.\n",
    "* **Mode collapse:**  The generator may get stuck on a small set of samples that always fool the discriminator. This reduces the capability of the network to produce novel samples.\n",
    "* **Uninformative loss:** The lack of correlation between the generator loss and quality of generated output makes plain GAN training difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Wasserstein GAN](#references) was a major advancement in GANs and helped mitigate to some of these issues. Some of its features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It significantly improves the interpretability of loss functions and provides clearer stopping criteria\n",
    "2. WGANs generally produce results of higher quality (demonstrated within the image generation domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematics of Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Wasserstein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric) between the true distribution $P_r$ and generated piano roll distribution $P_g$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{W}(P_{r},P_{g})=\\sup_{\\lVert{f} \\rVert_{L} \\le 1} \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathbb{P}_r}(f(x)) - \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathbb{P}_g}(f(x)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation we are trying to minimize the distance between the expectation of the real distribution and the expectation of the generation distribution. $f$ is subject to a technical constraint in that it must be [1-Lipschitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity).\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce the 1-Lipschitz condition that basically constraints the gradients from varying too rapidly we use the gradient penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient penalty**: We want to penalize the gradients of the critic. We implicitly define $P_{\\hat{x}}$ by sampling uniformly along straight lines between pairs of points sampled from the data distribution $P_r$ and the generator distribution $P_g$.   This was originally motivated by the fact that the optimal critic contains straight lines with gradient norm 1 connecting coupled points from $P_r$ and $P_g$. We use a penalty coefficient $\\lambda$= 10 as was recommended in the original paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "The loss with gradient penalty is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{L}(P_{r},P_{g},P_{\\hat{x}} )= \\mathbb{W}(P_{r},P_{g}) + \\lambda \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{x} \\sim \\mathbb{P}_\\hat{x}}[(\\lVert \\nabla_{\\hat{x}}D(\\hat{x}) \\rVert_2 -  1)^2]$$\n",
    "|\n",
    "This loss can be parametrized in terms of $w$ and $\\theta$. We then use neural networks to learn the functions $f_w$ (discriminator) and  $g_\\theta$ (generator).\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{W}(P_{r},P_{\\theta})=\\max_{w \\in \\mathbb{W}} \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathbb{P}_r}(D_w(x)) - \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}(D_w(G_{\\theta}(z)) $$\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{L}(P_{r},P_{\\theta},P_{\\hat{x}})=\\max_{w \\in \\mathbb{W}} \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathbb{P}_r}(D_w(x)) - \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}(D_w(G_{\\theta}(z)) + \\lambda \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{x} \\sim \\mathbb{P}_\\hat{x}}[(\\lVert \\nabla_{\\hat{x}}D_w(\\hat{x}) \\rVert_2 -  1)^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ \\hat{x} = \\epsilon x + (1- \\epsilon) G(z) $$ and $$\\epsilon \\sim Unif(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic procedure to train is as following: \n",
    "1. We draw real_x from the real distribution $P_r$ and fake_x from the generated distribution $G_{\\theta}(z)$ where $z \\sim p(z)$\n",
    "2. The latent vectors are sampled from z and then tranformed using the generator $G_{\\theta}$ to get the fake samples fake_x. They are evaluated using the critic function $D_w$\n",
    "3. We are trying to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the two distributions\n",
